# What I learned in this project
 - I learned the importance of git commit. It is necessary to have "save" of your project everytime you make a meaningful changes, so that when you messed up, you can always revert your code. Doing many ctrl-z's is tiring and inaccurate and unreliable.
# How should I improve the project in the future?
 - I will make it beautiful and add more features like michalosman did on his project like this.
